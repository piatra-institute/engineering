## Phase

**Phase 1: production prose at scale.** In progress. **All 174 chapters are at Stage 4 or later** as of 2026-06-03. Volume I is at Stage 5 (reviewed and resolved) and has been carried through a Tier 3 second pass to roughly full target density; Volumes II through XII are at Stage 4 (first-draft to Tier-1+2 density) awaiting Codex review. All drafted chapters compile in `main.pdf`. The discipline guards (`make check`, `make audit-docs`, `make accidents`, `make exercise-counts`) report PASS across the current state.

Per-volume state:

- **Volume I (Quantity)** — 9 of 9 chapters at **Stage 5**, carried to a **Tier 3 second pass** (2026-05-31 / 06-02). All carry Codex reviews at `docs/reviews/vol01-chNN-review.md` resolved with G fixes applied. The most advanced volume in the book; ~674 pp against a ~720 pp target.
- **Volume II (Form)** — 18 of 18 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review. **Tier 3 first AND second pass complete across ALL 18 chapters** (2026-06-05/06). First pass (Waves 1-5) deepened every chapter to ~55-65% of target; the second pass (Waves A-E, gap-prioritized) added a multi-page end-to-end CASE STUDY to most chapters plus more worked examples, figures, and mastery boxes. Representative case studies: geodetic levelling-network adjustment (Ch 9), machine-availability Markov chain (Ch 10), steel-plate quench (Ch 12), battery Coulomb-counting (Ch 6), Markowitz portfolio + truss sizing (Ch 15), error-budget cantilever (Ch 16), fatigue S-N inference (Ch 14), RLC + van der Pol + shooting method (Ch 7), load-strength reliability (Ch 13), M/M/c staffing under random demand (Ch 18), Hamming(7,4) codes (Ch 17), Machin's-formula pi to 10 digits (Ch 4), Welford running variance (Ch 1), machined-plate inertia (Ch 11), coaxial-cable field/capacitance (Ch 8), single-phase AC power-factor network (Ch 3), load-cell characterisation (Ch 2). A **third pass** (Waves F-I, 2026-06-06) then added a SECOND distinct multi-page case study to most chapters plus advanced worked examples and mastery boxes (e.g. Reed-Solomon over GF(16), symmetrical-components fault analysis, repairable-system CTMC availability, Peng-Robinson globalized Newton, FFT/spectral methods + convection-diffusion MMS, SIR + Robertson stiff kinetics, bridge structural-health PCA, FEM direct-stiffness truss + Leontief, network-contagion + feedback-control modelling, control-volume drag/lift). Ch 1 (~92%) and Ch 11 (~87%) were left after the second pass; the other 16 chapters got the third pass. Vol II now **~82% of dossier target (~1506 of ~1830 pp)** and compiles with **zero errors in the build**. Exercise counts held exactly throughout all three passes; no new bibliography entries required (all citations reuse existing keys); Ch 16 wired in the Vancouver Stock Exchange case using the existing registry entry. One more focused pass on the largest chapters (Ch 9, 10, 12) would reach Vol I's ~94% density.
- **Volume III (Force)** — 13 of 13 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review. **Tier 1+2 baseline pass complete across ALL 13 chapters** (2026-06-24, three parallel-agent waves). Each chapter started as text-plus-exercises only (no figures, code, data, or solutions) and gained: a full `\paragraph{Solution sketch.}` inside every exercise (446 solutions across the volume), 6-10 TikZ/pgfplots figures (113 new figure files), 3-6 code files, 2-4 datasets, expanded worked-examples sections, estimation blocks where missing, and 1-2 mastery boxes per chapter. Then a **Tier 3 deepening pass across ALL 13 chapters** (2026-06-24, three more parallel-agent waves of 4-5) added to every chapter a substantial multi-page END-TO-END CASE STUDY (numbers carried through), 3-4 more multi-step worked examples, 2-4 more figures, and another mastery box. Representative case studies: lifting-padeye stress + Goodman fatigue check (Ch 3), rotating-machinery FFT diagnosis + isolation-mount design (Ch 6), steel floor-beam design to deflection/LTB checks (Ch 8), air-receiver pressure-vessel sizing (Ch 9), two-vehicle accident reconstruction (Ch 4), industrial noise-control enclosure to OSHA dose (Ch 7), penstock water-hammer surge + surge-tank sizing (Ch 11), pipeline pump sizing with NPSH margin (Ch 12), supersonic rocket-nozzle design chamber-to-plume (Ch 13), jib-crane load-path FBD (Ch 1), Howe roof-truss full analysis (Ch 2), Castigliano frame deflection + drop-impact factor (Ch 5), gravity-dam stability (Ch 10). A **second Tier 3 pass across ALL 13 chapters** (2026-06-24, three more parallel-agent waves) then added a SECOND, distinct multi-page case study to every chapter plus 2-3 more worked examples, 2-3 more figures, and another mastery box each. Representative second case studies: rotating-flywheel disk stress + Lame thick-cylinder shrink-fit (Ch 3), centrally-loaded strut Euler/Johnson design (Ch 8), ring-stiffened external-pressure vacuum vessel (Ch 9), Venturi flow-metering station (Ch 11), quarter-car suspension tuning (Ch 6), auditorium reverberation design (Ch 7), hydrodynamic journal bearing (Ch 12), Mach-3 supersonic inlet (Ch 13), multi-leg sling lifting plan (Ch 1), parabolic suspension cable + retaining-wall stability (Ch 2), two-stage launch Delta-v budget (Ch 4), Rayleigh-Ritz column buckling + von Mises-truss snap-through (Ch 5), loaded-pontoon metacentric stability (Ch 10). A **third Tier 3 pass across ALL 13 chapters** (2026-06-27/28, three more parallel-agent waves) then added a third (or fourth) distinct multi-page case study to every chapter plus 3-4 more worked examples / long-form derivations, 2-4 more figures, and another mastery box each. Representative third case studies: fatigue-crack-growth Paris-law life + leak-before-break (Ch 3), welded plate-girder design (Ch 8), flat-bottom storage-tank shell courses (Ch 9), finite-wing lifting-line lift + induced drag (Ch 11), seismic base-isolation / TMD (Ch 6), reactive muffler / sonar (Ch 7), vehicle aero drag + journal-bearing companion (Ch 12), re-entry blunt-body aerothermodynamics (Ch 13), tower-crane tipping stability (Ch 1), 3D signpost-mast wind reactions (Ch 2), Hohmann orbital transfer (Ch 4), crashworthiness crumple-zone energy absorption (Ch 5), canal lock mitre-gate (Ch 10). Vol III went from ~274 pp to **~834 pp (~64% of the ~1300 pp dossier target)** and now carries **250 figures** (zero at session start). Exercise counts held exactly throughout; no new bibliography entries required (all citations reuse existing keys); the de Havilland Comet (1954) failure case was wired into Ch 9 using the existing registry entry. Across the three passes, several agent-authored figures shipped with a missing `\end{axis}` or a referenced-but-not-`\input` figure and were repaired; per-wave verification now includes an axis/tikz balance scan AND an orphan-figure scan. The third pass ran during a period of API instability (classifier-unavailable / connection-closed errors); affected chapters were re-run cleanly, and partial broken/orphan figures from killed agents were deleted or rebuilt. A **fourth Tier 3 pass** (2026-06-28) then shifted emphasis from new case studies to CORE-THEORY DEPTH: rigorous step-by-step derivations (stress transformation eigenproblem, Euler-Bernoulli + buckling, Kirchhoff plate biharmonic, Rankine-Hugoniot, Navier-Stokes / Couette-Poiseuille, the acoustic wave equation, continuity/Euler/Bernoulli/Kutta-Joukowski, polar kinematics, SDOF/MDOF vibration), plus 4-5 more worked examples, a short applied vignette, 2-3 figures, and a mastery box per chapter. The fourth pass is now complete on **12 of 13 chapters** (all except Ch 10, intentionally skipped at ~88% of its 80pp target); Ch 1, 5, 12 were finished after the API recovered. Vol III now stands at **~958 pp (~74% of the ~1300 pp dossier target)** with **286 figures**. Exercise counts held exactly throughout; no new bibliography/registry entries; per-wave verification (em-dash, tag-typo, axis/tikz balance, orphan-figure, and split-macro-key scans) keeps the build clean (one mid-key line-wrapped `\ref` in Ch 1 and several truncated/orphan figures from interrupted agents were repaired or deleted along the way). Next: optionally a fifth pass (and Ch 10) to close from ~74% toward Vol I/II density (~80-94%), or commission Codex reviews (Stage 4 -> 5).
- **Volume IV (Energy)** — 14 of 14 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review. **Tier 1+2 baseline pass complete across ALL 14 chapters** (2026-06-28, four parallel-agent waves). Each chapter started as text-plus-exercises only (no figures, code, data, or solutions) and gained: a `\paragraph{Solution sketch.}` (or Reference estimate / Model-answer sketch) inside every exercise (431 solutions across the volume), 8-11 TikZ/pgfplots figures (129 new figure files), 4-6 code files, 3-4 datasets, expanded worked-examples sections, estimation blocks, failure sections, and 1-2 mastery boxes per chapter. Exercise counts held exactly; no new bibliography/registry entries required (all citations reuse existing keys; existing accident keys cited where apt: Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Bhopal in Ch 5, Hubble optics in Ch 11). Two agents used `\textit`/`\textbf` for solution lead-ins instead of `\paragraph` and were normalized. Vol IV chapter source grew from ~12,000 to ~19,500 lines. **Tier 3 pass 1 complete across ALL 14 chapters** (2026-06-29, four parallel-agent waves): each chapter gained a multi-page END-TO-END CASE STUDY (steam-plant first-law audit Ch 1, LPG tank real-gas+phase Ch 2, combined-cycle gas turbine Ch 3, steam-plant exergy audit Ch 4, CPU heat-sink Ch 5, shell-and-tube kerosene cooler Ch 6, packed-column SO2 scrubber Ch 7, power transformer magnetic circuit Ch 8, regulated bench supply Ch 9, geostationary downlink link budget Ch 10, metro fibre link Ch 11, silicon PV cell Shockley-Queisser Ch 12, tokamak power balance Ch 13, solar+storage microgrid Ch 14), plus 2-3 more worked examples, 2-4 more figures, and a mastery box each. **Tier 3 pass 2 complete across ALL 14 chapters** (2026-06-29) added a SECOND distinct case study per chapter (gas-turbine fuel split Ch 1, steam Rankine state-points Ch 2, gasoline IC engine Ch 3, refrigerator exergy audit Ch 4, building-envelope retrofit Ch 5, plate-HX pasteurizer Ch 6, seawater RO Ch 7, coaxial line + capacitor bank Ch 8, switching buck converter Ch 9, radar detection range Ch 10, survey telescope Ch 11, white-LED luminaire Ch 12, plasma-etch reactor Ch 13, grid decarbonization pathway Ch 14) plus 2-4 more worked examples, 2-3 figures, and a mastery box each. **Tier 3 pass 3 complete across ALL 14 chapters** (2026-06-30) added a THIRD distinct case study per chapter AND rigorous core-theory derivations: CAES round-trip (Ch 1), CO2 transcritical cycle (Ch 2), ORC waste-heat (Ch 3), fuel-cell-vs-heat-engine second law (Ch 4), spacecraft thermal control (Ch 5), air-cooled gas cooler (Ch 6), PSA oxygen unit (Ch 7), brushless-DC machine (Ch 8), sensor signal-conditioning chain (Ch 9), microstrip patch antenna (Ch 10), time-of-flight LIDAR (Ch 11), Fabry-Perot laser diode (Ch 12), Hall-effect ion thruster (Ch 13), green-hydrogen power-to-X (Ch 14); each also gained 3-4 worked examples, 2-3 figures, and a mastery box. Vol IV now **~778 pp (~56% of the ~1400 pp target)** with **260 figures**. Exercise counts held exactly; no new bibliography/registry entries. The pass-3 prompts added an explicit no-deprecated-font-command (`\rm`/`\bf`/...) rule after the Ch 13 `\rm` incident in pass 2; the volume is now clean of those. **Tier 3 pass 4 complete across ALL 14 chapters** (2026-06-30 / 07-01) shifted emphasis to CORE-THEORY DEPTH plus one short applied vignette per chapter: rigorous derivations added throughout (Maxwell relations & exact differentials Ch 1; departure functions/corresponding-states/fugacity Ch 2; air-standard efficiency/MEP/regeneration Ch 3; Tds equations/potentials/third law Ch 4; heat-conduction PDE & convection scaling Ch 5; LMTD/effectiveness-NTU/F-factor Ch 6; Fick's-2nd/Chilton-Colburn/film models Ch 7; integral-differential Maxwell/gauge/quasistatics Ch 8; Laplace/Fourier/two-port/noise Ch 9; Friis/waveguide-modes/Fresnel Ch 10; ABCD matrices/thin-film/Fourier optics Ch 11; WKB tunnelling/Planck/Fermi-doping Ch 12; Saha/MHD/magnetic-pressure Ch 13; power-flow/LCOE/swing-equation/LOLP Ch 14), each with 4-5 worked examples, a vignette, figures, and a mastery box. Vol IV now **~922 pp (~66% of the ~1400 pp target)** with **302 figures**. Exercise counts held exactly; no new bibliography/registry entries. Pass 4 ran via async subagent batches; one batch hit a transient server rate-limit (re-run cleanly) and one referenced-but-not-`\input` figure (Ch 11) was caught by the orphan scan and wired in. **Tier 3 pass 5 complete across ALL 14 chapters** (2026-07-01, four async subagent waves of 3-4 chapters) added, per chapter, 5-7 new multi-step worked examples, one short applied vignette on a fresh device/system (solar-thermal collector + heat-tracing Ch 5, EGR cooler Ch 6, electrodialysis Ch 7, induction cooktop Ch 8, Colpitts oscillator Ch 9, passive RFID tag Ch 10, optical gyroscope Ch 11, resonant-tunnelling diode Ch 12, magnetron sputtering source Ch 13, data-centre behind-the-meter power Ch 14), 1-3 deepened prose sections, 2-3 new figures, and one more mastery box. Vol IV chapter source grew to ~44,350 lines. Vol IV now **~1046 pp (~75% of the ~1400 pp target)** with **345 figures**. Exercise counts held exactly; no new bibliography/registry entries (all reuse existing keys). All four guards (`check`, `exercise-counts`, `accidents`, `audit-docs`) PASS; per-wave verification (em-dash / deprecated-font / orphan / axis-balance / end-typo scans) clean. Full `make distclean && make` produces a 6223-page PDF. Next: bring Vol III to matching density and finish Vol II toward ~94%, per the four-top-volumes goal.
- **Volume V (Matter)** — 12 of 12 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review.
- **Volume VI (Life)** — 13 of 13 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review. Ch 11-13 drafted from Stage 1 in Wave 1 (2026-06-03); Ch 1-5 expanded to a Tier 3 baseline in Wave 2 (2026-06-03).
- **Volume VII (Information)** — 19 of 19 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review.
- **Volume VIII (Machines)** — 14 of 14 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review.
- **Volume IX (Systems)** — 19 of 19 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review.
- **Volume X (Failure)** — 16 of 16 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review.
- **Volume XI (Design)** — 13 of 13 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review. Ch 13 (the capstone) carries the integrative project for the volume rather than exercises.
- **Volume XII (Civilization)** — 14 of 14 chapters at **Stage 4** awaiting Codex review. Ch 14 (the book closer) carries the integrative personal-manifesto project rather than exercises.

Open lanes:

- **Codex review for Volumes II through XII** (165 chapters awaiting review on the same three-role protocol that carried Volume I from Stage 4 to Stage 5).
- **Tier 3 production-density pass** per volume: figures, project artifacts, expanded solution sets, case-study expansions, code/data co-located with each chapter. Vol I is the worked example; Vol II Wave 1 has begun the same pass. Q57 (page density vs target) is settled in practice: first-draft prose lands at ~10-44% of the planned page budget and the density pass closes the gap.

## What is queued

Active items from `open-questions.md`:

- **Q54 companion-note architecture**: spine vs companion-notes vs code repo vs data repo vs errata. Not yet decided. Load-bearing now that a production-density lane is running (figures, code, datasets all need a home).
- **Q57 page density vs target**: settled in practice. Twelve volumes of evidence show first-draft prose landing at ~10-44% of the planned page budget; the Tier 3 density pass (worked first on Vol I, now begun on Vol II) closes the gap.

Settled but kept on the wider planning radar:

- **Q51 reader-path model** (core / standard / mastery): settled 2026-04-28. Implemented through `\pathtag{}` on every section.
- **Q52 pilot chapter**: settled and surpassed; all nine Vol I chapters carried through Stage 5 and a Tier 3 second pass.
- **Q53 license confirmation**: settled 2026-04-28.
- **Q55 per-chapter project track**: fully settled across all 174 chapters as of 2026-06-03.
- **Q56 named-cases registry**: settled 2026-04-29; registry now holds 47 entries. All `acc:` keys cited in prose resolve to a registry entry; every named accident in prose carries at least one of its registry's citation keys.

Queued from `interludes.md`:

- III → IV revision (Force into Energy) acknowledging the Force/Energy/Matter unity. Status: queued, not applied.
- IV → V revision (Energy into Matter) closing the unity. Status: queued, not applied.

## Risks

The diagnostic identified three top risks (`docs/diagnostic.md`).

1. **Source-of-truth drift between generator and dossiers.** **Mitigated.** The generator reads dossiers as the canonical source; `make check` enforces `\chapmeta` presence on every chapter shell.
2. **Scale honesty for the reader.** **Substantially addressed.** Q57 has twelve volumes of evidence; the Tier 3 density pass is the mechanism that takes first-draft density to target.
3. **Verification (citation discipline, reproducible examples, table provenance).** **Substantially mitigated for Volume I; carried forward into Vols II-XII as first-draft discipline awaiting Codex review.** Bibliography grew to 1286 entries across the twelve-volume drafting. The Stage 4 review pass for Vols II-XII is the discipline carrier for the rest of the project.

## Build state

```
make distclean && make
```

Produces `main.pdf` at 6223 pages (latexmk exit 12 / make Error 2: the "needed too many passes" iteration cap on a document this large leaves refs/citations unresolved at the final pass, plus the recoverable Vol VI Ch 10-13 markdown-underscore errors remain, see below; PDF builds fully despite both). Note: a full `make distclean && make` now takes well over 10 minutes (the book is ~5400 pp with ~277 Vol III figures alone); allow ample time and do not run two builds concurrently (a second `distclean` will clobber the first build's `main.pdf`/`main.log`). `make check`, `make audit-docs`, `make accidents`, and `make exercise-counts` all report `PASS`. `make stats` reports the at-a-glance counts above. The build requires the enlarged TeX `main_memory` described below; without it the run aborts in Vol IV with `TeX capacity exceeded`.

Always build with `make distclean && make` (a fresh build). Incremental `latexmk` runs intermittently corrupt `main.bbl` (biber emits a runaway-argument bbl, symptom: "Paragraph ended before \name was complete" / "Loading a class or package in a group" at `\begin{document}`, no PDF). A `make distclean` clears the bad `.bbl`/`.bcf` (and any `*-SAVE-ERROR` files) and regenerates the bibliography cleanly.

Resolved build issues (2026-06-05): the Vol II Ch 11 PGF negative-sqrt figure error is fixed (`max(0,...)` clamp); the Vol VI Ch 6 cardiovascular figure path syntax is fixed; Vol VI Ch 9 was truncated (unclosed `exercise`, seven never-created figure `\input`s) and is now structurally valid (figures commented with a TODO for the Vol VI pass); Vol VI Ch 10 `engorange` color added to the preamble and the reserved `cells` TikZ key renamed.

TeX main-memory ceiling (2026-06-24): once Vol III gained 113 TikZ/pgfplots figures the whole-book build began failing with `! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=5000000]` partway through (Vol IV Ch 10), because pdftex's default arena is fixed at format-dump time and the accumulating per-document tables (labels, hyperref destinations, biblatex data) crossed it. Fix is **machine-local, no sudo, no repo change**: a user-level `texmf.cnf` at `$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/texmf.cnf` (`~/Library/texlive/2025/texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf` on this machine) sets `main_memory = 12000000`, then a user-local `pdflatex` format is rebuilt so the larger arena is baked in:

```
# write ~/Library/texlive/2025/texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf containing: main_memory = 12000000
TEXMFCNF="$(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG)/web2c:" fmtutil-user --byfmt pdflatex
```

`main_memory` is read only at format-dump time, so the `TEXMFCNF` override is needed for that one command; afterwards normal `make` runs use the baked-in 12M format automatically (the user `pdflatex.fmt` in TEXMFVAR precedes the system tree). Do not also raise `pool_size`/`save_size` in the same file: the combination tripped `Ouch---my internal constants have been clobbered!---case 14` and the dump failed; `main_memory` alone dumps cleanly. To revert, delete the line and rerun the `fmtutil-user` command. 12M clears the current ~4955 pp book with headroom; raise further (re-dump) if a future volume overflows again.

Known residual (deferred to the Vol VI production pass): ~66 recoverable "Missing $" / "Undefined control sequence" errors in Vol VI Ch 10-13 prose, caused by markdown-style backtick code spans with raw underscores (e.g. a bare `monod_growth_fit.py`). They do not stop the build (the PDF reaches 4205 pp) and are confined to Vol VI; the fix is to convert those spans to `\texttt{...}` / `\repopath{}` with escaped underscores when Vol VI is drafted to Tier 3.

## Operational notes

- `main.pdf` is gitignored; build locally.
- Scaffolding regeneration via `make scaffolding` (uses uv).
- The dossiers under `docs/research/` are the canonical per-volume editorial source. The generator reads them. Edit dossiers there; do not edit chapter shells directly for metadata changes.
- File slugs (`volumes/01-quantity/`, `_volume.tex`, `chNN-slug/chapter.tex`, `\label{vol01:ch01}`) are stable and not renamed.
- For repository paths in chapter prose, use the `\repopath{}` macro (a `\path{}` wrapper) rather than `\texttt{}`, which overflows the margin on long paths.
- Reviews live at `docs/reviews/`. The `Resolved: YYYY-MM-DD` banner at the top of a review file is the canonical signal that all G fixes have been applied; do not write that banner unless every G fix has actually been addressed.

## What good progress looks like

1. Bring Volume II to the Vol I standard: Tier 3 density pass across the remaining 15 chapters, and/or commission Codex reviews chapter by chapter (Stage 4 → Stage 5).
2. Fix the Vol II Ch 11 PGF figure error so full builds return a clean exit code.
3. Continue the Tier 3 density pass volume by volume (III onward), one chapter at a time in the main thread.
4. Settle Q54 (companion-note architecture) before the production-density lane scales further.
5. Apply or formally defer the queued III-IV and IV-V interlude revisions.

All twelve volumes of first-draft prose are on disk. The pipeline has been exercised at scale through Stage 4, and Volume I demonstrates the full Stage 4 → Stage 5 → Tier 3 path. The gating decisions now are review throughput and how aggressively the density pass runs, not whether the project can produce defensible chapters.
